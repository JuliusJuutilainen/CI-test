Findings:
- gh is a nice tool. Should be useful.
- Actions are easy to use and ready-made actions make life easy
- I hate .yaml syntax
- Getting used to this vs. Jenkins isn't too difficult, but I would have wished for better visualization tools.
  - Test, anybody? Maybe I'll try adding them...

TODO:
- add automatic tests
