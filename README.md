Findings:
- gh is a nice tool. Should be useful.
- Actions are easy to use and ready-made actions make life easy
- I hate .yaml syntax
- Getting used to this vs. Jenkins isn't too difficult, but I would have wished for better visualization tools.
- having pre-built actions is really useful. Poc is quick to do. Most difficulties with new syntax and such. 

TODO:
- nothing currently needs to be done here. Test succesful.
