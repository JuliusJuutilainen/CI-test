Findings:
- gh is a nice tool. Should be useful.
- Actions are easy to use and ready-made actions make life easy
- I hate .yaml syntax
- Getting used to this vs. Jenkins isn't too difficult, but I would have wished for better visualization tools.
- having pre-built actions is really useful. Poc is quick to do. Most difficulties with new syntax and such. 

TODO:
- nothing currently needs to be done here. Test succesful.
- Fine tuning:
  - only build/update when application files have been changed
  - Changing main/master branch should create new medium/major release tag...

Notes:
- This is a test repo. The app should only print "Hello World"
- Only supporting minor version bumps currently. I think the market options for something that does semver automatically are far and wide between. Might be worth it to code my own solution. (One action fits all kinda thing)
- This repo was a learning exercise. Don't look at the commits too much :D
